h1. Sleepy Driver Finder 

Quick (in thought - not necessarily in process) hack to find out if a driver is sleepy or not.

h2. Requirements

* "Shoes":http://shoooes.net/
* mPlayer to extract images from video
* ffmpeg or mencoder or both to create a video out of the images
* rmagick - used for all the image processing

h2. Normal workflow

* Split up video into a series of images.
** See the example command below
* Delete extra frames if necessary 
** Use the image_del script in the scripts folder
* Pick out the eyes in the images and save them to yaml
** Use the eye_spy script
** This this a shoes app.
* Make sure the paths in sleepy_driver_finder.rb are correct
** Most assume that everything is stored in the ./data directory
* Run the sleepy driver finder
** @ruby ./sleepy_driver_finder.rb@
* Stitch resulting images back together
** See example command below

h2. Example commands

Example command to split up video into images:
  mPlayer -vo jpeg:quality=100:outdir=./images/ ./kaiduan.mpg
	
Example command to rejoin all images back to a video:
	ffmpeg -r 3 -i result-%01d.jpg test18002.mp4
	
Example command to rejoin all images -- works if the file names are not sequential
	mencoder "mf://*.jpg" -mf fps=5 -o test.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=msmpeg4v2:vbitrate=800
